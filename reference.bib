abstract = {This study presents a peridynamic model with an improved energy-based surface correction to simulate fractures of random porous materials. There exists a surface effect due to incomplete neighborhoods of boundary or near-boundary points in peridynamics. A surface correction approach is proposed to correct the surface effect on or near the boundaries, including outer boundaries of the materials and boundaries of inner pores. The correction factor is obtained based on the equivalence between the strain energy density in classical continuum mechanics and the elastic energy density in peridynamics. The algorithm procedure for the corrected model based on the finite element analysis is brought forward in detail. The availability of the proposed corrected peridynamic model is verified by comparing the results against the results by the classical continuum mechanics model. Moreover, the effect of the surface correction on the crack growth path and the impact of random distributions of pores on the fractures of porous materials are also investigated. Numerical results demonstrate that the present method can effectively correct the surface effect of random porous materials, especially around the boundary of inner pores, where shows a more obvious surface effect.}
